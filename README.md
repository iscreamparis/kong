KONG is a standalone CLI that eliminates duplicated dependencies across all your projects. Every package lives once on disk — shared by hard links and NTFS junctions. Your project sees a normal `.venv`, `node_modules`, and `.cargo` folder. Nothing changes for your tools. Everything changes for your disk.

**No pip. No npm. No cargo install. No external package managers at all.** KONG talks directly to PyPI, the npm registry, and crates.io — in-house, in Rust.

---

## Why KONG?

If you work on 10 Python projects, you currently have 10 copies of `numpy`. With Node.js it's worse — `node_modules` is infamous for a reason. With Rust, the same 478 crates get re-downloaded per project.

KONG fixes this with a **content-addressable global store** at `~/.kong/` (or `C:\kong\` on Windows). Same package + version = one copy on disk, hard-linked into every project that needs it.

pnpm proved this model works for Node.js. KONG extends it to all three ecosystems at once.

## Install

### With KONG (recommended — bootstraps itself)

Already have KONG? Update or install on a new machine in one line:

**Windows (PowerShell, as Administrator):**
```powershell
kong clone https://github.com/iscreamparis/kong
cd kong
kong rules
kong use kong.rules
.  .\.rust-toolchain\activate.ps1   # activates kong-managed cargo + rustc
cargo build --release
Copy-Item target\release\kong.exe C:\kong\kong.exe
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
kong clone https://github.com/iscreamparis/kong
cd kong
kong rules && kong use kong.rules
source .rust-toolchain/activate.sh   # activates kong-managed cargo + rustc
cargo build --release && sudo cp target/release/kong /usr/local/bin/kong
```

> KONG manages its own build dependencies — including the Rust toolchain. No `rustup` required.
> The activation script adds the toolchain to PATH for the current console only — no system-wide changes.

---

### From the installer (first install)

Download the latest binary for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/iscreamparis/kong/releases/latest) and put it on your PATH.

**Windows (PowerShell, as Administrator):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/iscreamparis/kong/releases/latest/download/kong-windows-x86_64.exe" -OutFile "C:\kong\kong.exe"
# The installer also adds C:\kong to your system PATH
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/iscreamparis/kong/releases/latest/download/kong-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/kong
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kong
```

### From source (requires an existing Rust toolchain)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iscreamparis/kong
cd kong
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/kong
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Go to your project
cd my-project

# 2. Scan manifests and generate kong.rules (downloads all deps to the global store)
kong rules

# 3. Wire up .venv / node_modules / .cargo in the project directory
kong use kong.rules

# 4. Activate the Rust toolchain (current console only)
. .\.rust-toolchain\activate.ps1   # Windows
source .rust-toolchain/activate.sh  # Linux / macOS

# 5. Work normally — your tools see nothing different
python src/app.py
node src/index.js
cargo build --release

# 6. Run scripts defined in package.json or pyproject.toml
kong run dev
kong run build
kong run test
```

Second project using the same packages? `kong rules` + `kong use` — instant, no downloads, just links.

---

## How It Works

```
kong rules                          kong use kong.rules
─────────────────                   ───────────────────────────────
reads manifests          →          creates junctions / hard links
  requirements.txt                    .venv/          → store/.venv
  package.json                        node_modules/   → store/node_modules
  Cargo.lock                          .cargo/config   → src replacement

queries registries       →          your tools run unchanged
  PyPI JSON API                       python, node, cargo, vite...
  npm registry
  crates.io

downloads + verifies     →          global store (written once)
  SHA-256 checked                     ~/.kong/store/
  hard links shared                   ├── python/libs/numpy-2.2.4/
                                      ├── node/libs/vite-6.3.1/
                                      └── rust/crates/tokio-1.44.2/
```

**The key insight:** KONG creates NTFS junctions (Windows) or symlinks (Linux/macOS) from your project directory into its central store. Vite, Python, Node.js, and Cargo all find their packages by walking up the filesystem — exactly as they would with a real local install. No wrappers. No shims. No `PATH` tricks.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kong clone <url>` | Clone a git repo (use `--setup` to auto-run rules + use) |
| `kong rules` | Scan manifests, download all deps, write `kong.rules` |
| `kong rules --force` | Re-download everything even if already in store |
| `kong use kong.rules` | Create `.venv`, `node_modules`, `.cargo` via links |
| `kong use kong.rules --clean` | Tear down and rebuild the project environment |
| `kong run <script>` | Run a script from `package.json` or `pyproject.toml` |
| `kong run <script> -- <args>` | Pass extra arguments to the script |
| `kong store path` | Print the global store path |
| `kong doctor` | Check store integrity and environment health |

---

## Supported Manifests

| Ecosystem | Parsed | Lockfile preferred |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| Python | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` | `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` |
| Node.js | `package.json` | `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | `Cargo.lock` ✓ |

---

## The Store

Everything lives in a single content-addressable store:

```
~/.kong/                              (C:\kong\ on Windows)
├── store/
│   ├── python/
│   │   ├── runtime/3.10.20/         ← KONG-managed Python interpreter
│   │   └── libs/
│   │       ├── numpy-2.2.4/
│   │       └── flask-3.1.1/
│   ├── node/
│   │   ├── runtime/24.14.1/         ← KONG-managed Node.js
│   │   └── libs/
│   │       └── vite-6.3.1/
│   └── rust/
│       ├── toolchain/1.94.1/        ← KONG-managed rustc + cargo
│       └── crates/
│           └── tokio-1.44.2/
└── RULEZ/
    └── my-project/                  ← wired environments per project
        ├── .venv/
        └── node_modules/
```

Packages are stored **once** and **hard-linked** into every project that needs them. Cross-drive projects (e.g. source on `Q:`, store on `C:`) use NTFS junctions instead.

## Real Project Example — DummyKong

[DummyKong](https://github.com/iscreamparis/DummyKong) is KONG's reference test project: a Flask backend + Vite/Vue frontend + Rust fractal renderer, all managed by KONG.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/iscreamparis/DummyKong
cd DummyKong
kong rules          # downloads Flask, Vue, fractal crates — all to global store
kong use kong.rules # wires .venv, node_modules, .cargo into project dir
.\run.ps1           # starts Flask :5000 + Vite :5173 + renders ASCII fractal
```

No pip. No npm. No conda. No rustup. Just KONG.

## Roadmap

### v0.2 — Performance
- [ ] **Parallel downloads** — all packages fetched concurrently (currently sequential)
- [ ] **Progress bars** — `indicatif` integration for long downloads
- [ ] **Resume on failure** — partial downloads restart from where they stopped

### v0.3 — Broader compatibility
- [ ] **Python resolver** — resolve `>=` version constraints without a lockfile
- [ ] **`kong shell`** — drop into an activated shell for a project
- [ ] **`kong add <pkg>`** — add a package and update `kong.rules` in one step

### v0.4 — Git integration (lite)
- [ ] **`kong clone <url>`** — clone a repo and run `kong rules` + `kong use` in one step, for fresh machines without git installed
- [ ] **`kong login`** — authenticate with GitHub/GitLab for private repos
- [ ] Bundles a minimal `git` client (clone, fetch, pull) via the `gitoxide` / `gix` Rust crate — no system git required

### v1.0 — Production
- [ ] private registry support
- [ ] Windows installer with proper PATH management (NSIS → WiX)
- [ ] `kong doctor` full report with auto-fix suggestions
- [ ] Linux/macOS binary CI pipeline

## Design Principles

- **No external package managers.** KONG never calls `pip`, `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `cargo install` as subprocesses. All registry communication is in-house via `reqwest`.
- **Idempotent.** Every command is safe to re-run. Already in store? Skip the download. Link already exists? Skip the link.
- **Transparent.** Your project directory looks exactly like a normal project to every tool. KONG is invisible at runtime.
- **Windows-first.** NTFS junctions + hard links. Long paths. `\\?\` prefixes where needed.
